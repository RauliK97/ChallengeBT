Hello

My name is Raul and I am glad to present you my challenge-application that I spent a great deal of time and resources to complete in a manner worthy of my skills :)

I used EmailJS API to send the email with security code, it is free up to 200 mails per month.
As there is no database, no account verification is made so the only validation, besides not leaving email or password field blank, is the response from EmailJS API. If it responses with code 200 then you are instructed to input security code sent to the provided email address. If the correct code is not inserted in the given time frame ( 120 seconds ) then you'll be shown a message that the code expired and you have to go back to login.
Upon inserting the security code you'll be grated access to the secured content which I chose to be the old challenge I was given before the current one. User is prompted to select a location for which the weather status will be displayed. Weather for up to five locations will be shown at a time.

I really enjoyed working on this application because there are a few things I never did before and I learned a great deal about them.

Thank you for your time and for this chance I was given,
Marian Raul
